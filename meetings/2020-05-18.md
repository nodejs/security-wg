### nodejs/security-wg

* https://github.com/nodejs/security-wg/issues/614 - Agreed to onboard Daniel.
* https://github.com/nodejs/security-wg/issues/628 - No objections, we should complete moving DB to security-advisories repo, then change the name.
* https://github.com/nodejs/security-wg/pull/627 - Liran will reach out to confirm that Matt is still interested, and if so, will merge the PR, will be good to have more triagers.
* https://github.com/nodejs/security-wg/issues/626 - Need Vladimir to review but basically this sounds like a Node.js core issue we should open and tag the security-wg for interest conversation
* https://github.com/nodejs/security-wg/issues/511 - Weâ€™ll ping some folks to get involved but no actionable item to take on this at the moment.
* https://github.com/nodejs/security-wg/issues/604 - Taking actions on this:
1. Update the policies (triage process, program page, security.md for the nodejs website, github.com/nodejs/node/security.md) for the updated threshold.
2. Are we all agreeing on the threshold of 10000 monthly downloads as an eligible module for us?
