### nodejs/security-wg

* Paying Bounties on HackerOne [#593](https://github.com/nodejs/security-wg/issues/593)
US$500 for critical
US$250 for high
Discussed in the WG agenda meeting and nobody rejects so let's kick off the bounty payments.
* Membership review [#591](https://github.com/nodejs/security-wg/issues/591)
Some members did not reply, will try to contact them once more over email social media to make sure they aren’t just on vacation, then remove them from the WG.
* Proposal to use CVSS v3.1 [#590](https://github.com/nodejs/security-wg/pull/590)
Sam: I have no comment. I’m not familiar enough to know if there are any issues, or if its an obvious update.
* Reaching out to other projects of the OpenJS Foundation [#511](https://github.com/nodejs/security-wg/issues/511)
For this to move forward, it will need at least one champion, to push it forward, meet with the OJS foundation, etc. We’ll ping in the issue to look for a leader.
