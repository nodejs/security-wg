## Agenda

## Announcements

*Extracted from **security-wg-agenda** labeled issues and pull requests from the **nodejs org** prior to the meeting.

* No announcements this week

- [x] Vulnerability Review - https://github.com/nodejs/nodejs-dependency-vuln-assessments/issues
  - Seems like some OpenSSL low level vulnerabilities are not detected by the automation, probably as they are not yet registered in NIST

- [x] OpenSSF Scorecard Monitor Review - 
  - Report updated in https://github.com/nodejs/security-wg/pull/1327, seems like we decreased in Node.js due vulnerabilities (more details: https://github.com/nodejs/security-wg/pull/1327#issuecomment-2151671450). This might be an error as it is the first time that is reported and the CVEs are from 2022
