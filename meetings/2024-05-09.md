### nodejs/node

* Remove --experimental-policy [#52575](https://github.com/nodejs/node/issues/52575)
  * Has been removed in main

### nodejs/security-wg

* Discuss adding --security-revert to NODE_OPTIONS [#1262](https://github.com/nodejs/security-wg/issues/1262)
  * We discussed and the consensus of those at the meeting was to proceed with the Env variable AND cveRevert API call being needed to revert as an additional option to the command line. Michael will summarize in the issue and then we can figure out how to create a PR that incorporates the approach.

* Node.js Security Initiatives 2024 [#1255](https://github.com/nodejs/security-wg/issues/1255)

* Proposed approach for build steps in deps which are not in make node  [#1236](https://github.com/nodejs/security-wg/issues/1236)
  * Michael experimenting with building wasm build containers in https://github.com/mhdawson/node-wasm-build, looking good so far in terms of implementing the proposed approach.
    * built GitHub action to build container and push to ghcr.io
    * Based on what undici was doing to build container

* Security initiative in December 2023: fuzzing Nodejs: https://github.com/google/oss-fuzz/tree/master/projects/nodejs 
[#1159](https://github.com/nodejs/security-wg/issues/1159)

## Q&A, Other

Best Practices badge update:
- Ulises has created two PRs that require some work to justify our responses (https://github.com/nodejs/security-wg/pull/1306 and https://github.com/nodejs/security-wg/pull/956)
- Currently, the Scoring is not correct, as after the edition the responses were deleted by the application (seems like a bug)
