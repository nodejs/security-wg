### nodejs/node

* src: add WDAC integration (Windows) #54364
  * Robert W summarised this feature and what it intends to protect.
  * Rafael asked if this is turned on by default
  * Robert W explained this is turned on via system configuration, so for Windows users that don’t make use of catalogue policy, it won’t be enabled by default. 
  * Some discussions about security expectations, running this on untrusted code
  * The documentation will be aligned with Node.js threat model. This feature won’t prevent malicous code from bypassing it. This will serve as an extra layer of security for Node.js applications. 
  * More discussion on implementation on Node.js
