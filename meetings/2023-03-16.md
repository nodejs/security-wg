### nodejs/security-wg

* Permission Model - Roadmap [#898](https://github.com/nodejs/security-wg/issues/898)
New roadmap available (on going)
There is an issue preventing the final release. See: https://github.com/nodejs/node/pull/44004#issuecomment-1458726634

* Improve SecurityWG Scorecard [#884](https://github.com/nodejs/security-wg/issues/884)
Great progress has been made with good participation from the community.
Fuzzing will require more support as we are not yet sure how to be implemented (Thomas is leading)
Code-review can be considered completed, but as it is an accumulative score it will take a while to reflect the full score.
Varun/Ashish will investigate why we still get a HIGH tag when score is 8/10

* Assessment against best practices (OpenSSF Scorecards ...) [#859](https://github.com/nodejs/security-wg/issues/859)
Ulises will change the current workflow to use Pull Request and not directly writing files in the repo
Demo driven by Varun/Ashish about https://app.stepsecurity.io/. 
Created this issue to see if nodejs/official-images is used - https://github.com/nodejs/docker-node/issues/1865

* Add OSSF Scorecard [#851](https://github.com/nodejs/security-wg/issues/851)
