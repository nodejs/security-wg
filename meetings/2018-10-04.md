### nodejs/security-wg

* \[ANN\]: refactor report id field to be auto-generating, Deadline: 10.11.2018 [#402](https://github.com/nodejs/security-wg/issues/402)
  * please review and comment in the issue
* Migrate vulnerability database to it own repo [#359](https://github.com/nodejs/security-wg/issues/359)
  * We made progress to get a free account for Algolia so weâ€™re able to host an API to search
  *  vulnerabilities, as well as a website. Vladimir will also work on creating an
  *  npm module to provide all of this functionality.
* Create issue to propose session at JSInteractive collaborator summit [#358](https://github.com/nodejs/security-wg/issues/358)
  * Scheduled for Day 2

* Reed any feedback on the community program. 
  * If you exceed the SLA, the program gets suspended. Have
    been paused a few times already.
  * We should be able to be resumed now.
  * Have a bot which welcomes, but does not triage it.

  * Core triage program
    * Seems to be running pretty smoothly
    * Good portion of initial reports are out of scope or not applicable

  * Had talked about reaching to Foundation to pay bounties for reporting
    Vulnerabilities.
    * Probably needs to wait until we have enough people triaging so that we 
      are on top of existing vulnerability reports.

## Q&A, Other

* No questions this week.
