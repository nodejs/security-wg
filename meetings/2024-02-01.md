  * off agenda because we wanted to take some time to make a decision
  * Marco
    * Suggest we make decision to start with cyclone dx
      * seems like the easiest way to move forward than alternatives
      * its being standardized
      * will start with it being private so that we can look at it before sharing more widely
      * start with easier dependencies
    * Michael, sounds good +1
      * if somebody else wants to also work on some alternative, happy to
        have them do that as well
