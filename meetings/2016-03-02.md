# Agenda

## Nsp donation

- Adam: in legal-land, working on legal aspects of transfer/the bill of sale
- Sam: what are we going to get?
- Adam: individual files, or one blob, zipped or tarred
- https://github.com/nodejs/security-wg/issues/16 had an example  data
- Adam: used to just store it in git with a json file per blob, so its easily
  machine consumable, a nice API could come later
- Sam: what is process for accepting?
- Adam: public vs private is an issue, and there is an ISO document on
  responsible disclosure, and it defines our role as a co-ordinator
- Sam: anybody here intend to import the data?
- Vladimir: Sqreen will use
- Danny: we will use it as well, this is interesting for reference,
  https://github.com/distributedweaknessfiling/
- Adam: if we start with JSON, we can mutate to other forms
- Danny: happy with JSON, and other projects are also storing in git repos as
  vulnerabilty-per-file
- Sam: I think we’ll move conversation on format to github
- Josh Brown-White: Microsoft would be interested in importing the data, and
  also contributing, and pulling from a github repo isn’t an issue

## How to manage disclosure

- Josh B-W: consider https://www.hackerone.com/. He has used for reporting, good
  experience, but hasn’t seen it from the vendor side of the platform
- Danny: no direct experience
- Josh B-W: also maybe bug crowd?
- Deian Stefan: haven't used hackerone, only bugzilla and chrome's tools
- happy to look at it if it would be helpful

## Tangent

- Josh B-W: has resources for analysis.
- Sam: we use Coverity right now, but other things would be useful
- Josh B-W: offers to run some or all of their suite of tools on Node.js
- Josh B-W: Springfield in particular might be useful,
  https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/springfield/
- Josh B-W: worth considering that even once a fix is published, it can be time
  consuming to get the fix propagated into infrastructure. Something to consider
  in our process.
