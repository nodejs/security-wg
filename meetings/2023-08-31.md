### nodejs/security-wg

* Load permission settings from config files [#1074](https://github.com/nodejs/security-wg/issues/1074)
  * With addition of node env which is in process, may be able to pass through that file instead of a separate file.  However, env variables have limits and so may not be a general answer.  At this point options are limited so limitations may not be an issue.

* Audit build process for dependencies [#1037](https://github.com/nodejs/security-wg/issues/1037)
  * No updates this week.
  * Possibly, we'll have a brainstorming next week with interested people
