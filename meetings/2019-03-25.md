Pushed to the next meeting since nobody involved was present.

* Large-scale disclosure guidelines [505](https://github.com/nodejs/security-wg/issues/505)
Is there value in continuing to get reports about `new Buffer()`
It is still widely used in the ecosystem and it is not going away soon
Warning people about
Chalker: deprecated buffer constructor usage is not decreasing in ecosystem
Sam: if they are not changing, using a vulnerability report to put more pressure is a good lever
Vladimir: but not all users of constructor are going to be actual vulnerabilities, can we report them as such if we donâ€™t know
Not removed in 12.x because there are too many users, number of users not going down, so we are at an impasse
Tierney: volunteers to go out and talk to package maintainers, chalker gave access to https://github.com/nodejs-private/buffer-ecosystem-usage
