## Agenda

## Announcements

* Rafael - Security release next week, will also include CVE for old versions, so scanners will
  report old versions as vulnerable. More reason to make sure you are updated to latest
   versions.

*Extracted from **security-wg-agenda** labelled issues and pull requests from the **nodejs org** prior to the meeting.

- [X] Vulnerability Review - https://github.com/nodejs/nodejs-dependency-vuln-assessments/issues
  - https://github.com/nodejs/nodejs-dependency-vuln-assessments/issues/193 is false positive,
    and Node.js is not affected based on Node.js threat model so unlikely to be addressed in
    older versions due to risk.
- [X] OpenSSF Scorecard Monitor Review
  - PR: https://github.com/nodejs/security-wg/pull/1424
  - Analysis: Seems like some projects are rising due to good maintenance (removed permissions, ci
    validation, etc...) üëç. So far seems like no action needed from our side
  - Rafael need to run step security again on Node.js core since we‚Äôve added some actions. Rafael
     will do that.
Michael is it possible to automate to run once a month ?
Rafael, don‚Äôt think so but lets open an issue in the repo and then at mention them to ask if
             That is possible.

### nodejs/node

* src: add WDAC integration (Windows) [#54364](https://github.com/nodejs/node/pull/54364)
  * Issue being discussed/figured out is around synchronous checks

### nodejs/security-wg

* Add a warning on EOL versions [#1401](https://github.com/nodejs/security-wg/issues/1401)
  * Plan is to wait to see impact of CVEs we have issued, and then re-evaluate if a warning makes sense
  * Zibby was it discussed before to add a time at which warnings would be generated, as
    upgrade to newer version with the warning is unlikely.
    * Marco, Rafael, Michael, was discussed and discarded based on concerns.

* Node.js maintainers: Threat Model [#1333](https://github.com/nodejs/security-wg/issues/1333)
  * worked on it in doc

* Audit build process for dependencies [#1037](https://github.com/nodejs/security-wg/issues/1037)
  * Michael, all three deps use shared common wasm builder approach/containers
  * Michael, next step is to work on updaters for cjs-module-lexer and amaro to ensure we can
    build from what is in deps directory

* Automate security release process [#860](https://github.com/nodejs/security-wg/issues/860)
  * Rafael, almost done, have been validated over last few security releases, just a few small
     things left to be done.
