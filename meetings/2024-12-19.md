### nodejs/node

* src: add WDAC integration (Windows) [#54364](https://github.com/nodejs/node/pull/54364)
Robert is working on it (isolation building on windows only) and will keep working on it.
Discussion around the feedback collected on the PR:
Request to work using snapshotable API (seems like use a separate scope is the way to go) for better testing
Rafael, I don’t believe we need to use the snapshotable API for this POC yet
