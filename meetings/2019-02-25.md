*Extracted from **security-wg-agenda** labelled issues and pull requests from the **nodejs org** prior to the meeting.

### nodejs/security-wg

* Added Ron Perris to the list of current team members. #490 [#492](https://github.com/nodejs/security-wg/pull/492)

* Nominate myself Ron Perris to join the Security WG and Triage team [#490](https://github.com/nodejs/security-wg/issues/490)

Landing the PR. Welcome Ron!

* How can we utilize funding for the ecosystem bug bounty program? [#475](https://github.com/nodejs/security-wg/issues/475)
  * Liran is talking to coinbase about funding
  * Have to figure out criteria for when bounty is paid, but we have time
  * Agreed on the split between bounties/swag.
  * Liran will connect with coinbase to discuss next steps.
  * Liran will open an issue to discuss would to award bounties

* Migrate vulnerability database to it own repo [#359](https://github.com/nodejs/security-wg/issues/359)
  * Next step is to announce that migration will occur in next 60 days
  * Announcement will need wide broadcast: retweet by foundation, node.js blog,
    anywhere else?

* Creation of index.json files. 
  * Pulls together all files into a single file
  * Byron/Michael concern about duplicated data.
  * Want to have it in a form which consumable in general user land
  * Node release lines, uses the data and combines the data internally in a similar way
  * David has a project that has a requirement to read all the vuln json into a single blob:
    https://github.com/dgonzalez/gammaray
  * Tierney makes the case that individual files are more maintainable, but he does like the
    consumability of a single json blob
  * Liran discusses the idea of a npm package version of the vuln DB, that third party tools
    could depend on. He’d like to work with Tierney on building such a module.

## Q&A, Other

* question about whether Node.js is more secure than Java
  * this is quite a complex question and not necessarily the scope of this group
    to compare to Java so we don’t have an answer we can add.
