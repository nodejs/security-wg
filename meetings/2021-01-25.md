### nodejs/security-wg

* Nominate GENTILHOMME Thomas as member of the WG [#678](https://github.com/nodejs/security-wg/issues/678)
* Done and merged

* Refocusing the Ecosystem Security WG on OpenJS Foundation projects [#662](https://github.com/nodejs/security-wg/issues/662)
* We closed the H1 program, the question might be wider: what is the new goal/alignment of the Security WG?
* Thomas: focusing on Foundation would be a good idea
* Eva: we always wanted to get requirement for H1 scope higher - now, we could focus on OpenJS - We need to find a communication channel with the projects
* Vlad: we could help the projects with their security posture altogether and help them raise the bar there
* TODO(Vlad): Can we set up a bug bounty only for OpenJS? Let’s revive the issue

* Adding myself to the Members List based on #434  [#627](https://github.com/nodejs/security-wg/pull/627)
* let’s re-ask Matt and close if no response by next month
