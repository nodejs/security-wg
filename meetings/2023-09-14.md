### nodejs/security-wg

* Audit build process for dependencies
[#1037](https://github.com/nodejs/security-wg/issues/1037)
  * Meeting today with Marco, Ashish, Michael brainstorming to get started. Came up with some things to start building the list of what to check (uses npm, pulls github release, etc.). Also need to agree on what we consider an immutable source, versus one that we might need to create a copy of.
  * Ulises, discussion about scripts, good to have check for licenses.  Could add check for license in dependency update script. Ulises will open an issue in the repo to discuss adding it (Ref: https://github.com/nodejs/security-wg/issues/1104).
