# Agenda

## HackerOne Demo

Reed gave a demo of HackerOne’s dashboard.  He sent out a bunch of demo
accounts.  If you didn’t get an email and would like a demo account please ping
@reedloden (reed @ hackerone.com)

Can’t set an “auto-disclosure” after X days of filings in the settings (though
you can after a bug was resolved), but probably possible with the API.
Normally disclosure requires an intentional act within the report UI.

Full API (https://api.hackerone.com).  Probably not a Node.js library for it
yet (Ruby, Python, Go, etc. are present)

Can issue CVEs for both node and npmjs.org packages if we choose to go down
that route.

Two possible use-cases:
1. Node vulnerabilities
2. Npmjs.org package vulnerabilities

For npmjs.org packages, HackerOne looks to have a great feature set, CVE
issuance and the rich permission model among them.


I’d like to see some investigation of the API to ensure we can pull issues out
as JSON for storage in github.com, but otherwise I think we should try it out.

For node vulnerabilities, we’ll have to pitch HackerOne to the core members of
the Node Security Response Team, Ben and Fyodor at least. The thing they might
find most compelling for use with node core relates to permissions, since the
Response team size has been described as too large recently. Use of HackerOne
will allow:
- Web or email submission of vulnerabilities, with the submitter being allowed
  to view and discuss the submission directly using the web UI.
- The conversation history to be made public when a vulnerability is
  publicized: ATM all conversations about vulnerabilities are private for ever,
  unnecessarily.
- A triage team of 3 or 4 people who can see every submission, and either
  reject it as not a vulnerability, or assign it to the correct people to work on
  it further (those people would get access to only the one specific pre-release
  vulnerabilty). This would allow, for example, HTTP experts who are not on the
  Response team to be brought into the discussion of an HTTP issue. It would also
  allow the setup of a team to further triage npmjs.org package vulnerability
  reports, so the response team can re-assign non-node core vulnerabilities.

## rubysec organization

- Github: https://github.com/rubysec/ruby-advisory-db
- Stores vuln per file, covers both gems (`gems/`) and ruby runtimes (`rubies`)
- Every vuln has a CVE or a OSVDB, but the OSF (open security foundation) has
  closed shop, and all the OSVDB links are now dead
- Vuln files are named after the CVE/OSVDB ID, so they must request one for every
  submitted vuln. @reedloden of HackerOne manages this process, allocating them
  for ruby. It involves filling in a form of basic information, and he offered
  to do this for Node.js as well.
- Vuln schema: https://github.com/rubysec/ruby-advisory-db#schema
- Vulns can be submitted via PR, or a form (https://rubysec.com/advisories/new),
  but there isn’t any information on what the disclosure policy is. The form
  suggests to me that they expect to see only reports for issues that are already
  publically known and reported to the gem authors (and possibly already fixed).
- A tool is included to check for vulnerabilities:
  https://github.com/rubysec/bundler-audit
- Has a website: https://rubysec.com/, from which you can get Atom updates of
  vulns, browse the DB using a web UI, report vulnerabilities, and it also points
  to the bundler audit utility.
- No information on policies or procedures that I found.
