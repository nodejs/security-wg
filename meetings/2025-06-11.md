## Agenda

## Announcements

*Extracted from **security-wg-agenda** labelled issues and pull requests from the **nodejs org** prior to the meeting.

- [X] Vulnerability Review - https://github.com/nodejs/nodejs-dependency-vuln-assessments/issues
  - We have reviewed the https://github.com/nodejs/nodejs-dependency-vuln-assessments/issues/213 and we don't believe those CVEs affects Node.js
- [X] OpenSSF Scorecard Monitor Review - https://github.com/nodejs/security-wg/pull/1532
  - No meaningful updates
  - Good improvement on CITGM - Updated dependencies.

### nodejs/security-wg

- Reduce meeting frequency to monthly [#1527](https://github.com/nodejs/security-wg/issues/1527)
  - Active discussions are happening on OpenJS Security Collab Space

* Create a VEX file for Node.js [#1517](https://github.com/nodejs/security-wg/issues/1517)
  - +1 from the team
  - Marco will create a PR to move forward with this initiative 

### nodejs/node

* Auditing permissions [#59935](https://github.com/nodejs/node/issues/59935)
  - Draft PR has been created
  - Rafael, currently the feature is emitting a warning to the console, but I don't think this is good. It would be much better to send the warning through a place where users can consume, like diagnostics_channel, however, there's no native implementation of dc yet, so we'll need to create one from scratch. Non-trivial work. 

* src: add WDAC integration (Windows) [#54364](https://github.com/nodejs/node/pull/54364)
  - TOCTOU issues 
  - Removed from the agenda as its stale

  - We have set up https://github.com/npm-pub-2025
  - We need to consolitate step 2 and step 3 into just one
    - https://expressjs/ci-workflows
  - Proposal to have this action available for users to re-use
  - We'll compare our strategy with npm recent changes
  - Package Maintenance Working Group will set up a meeting to work technically on these actions - https://github.com/nodejs/package-maintenance
    - Next actions: Schedule the meeting,
    - Propose the action to the pkgjs organization,
    - Reduce the GOVERNANCE from pkgjs to handle small groups of maintainers - e.g 1 - 2 approvals for PRs
