  * Page on website we can easily direct module owners as FAQ that explains why we contact
     them for a vulnerability, get it onto 
  * Better track progress on triage, and reports on HackerOne.  Build analytics to report on 
    key metrics. 

  * Came up with idea to have a seperate "wishlist" repository were the issues would be opened.  Has a number of
    nice attributes:
    * Does not clutter wg repo with issues that may or may not get actioned.
    * One common place for people across the project to look for things they might contributed to.
