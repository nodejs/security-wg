  "ref": "https://github.com/nodejs/node/issues/7047#issuecomment-222393982",
  "overview": "This fixes a possible security concern (reported by Feross Aboukhadijeh) where\nuser input is passed unchecked to the Buffer constructor or `allocUnsafe()` as\nit can expose parts of the memory slab used by other Buffers in the application.\nNote that negative lengths are not supported by the Buffer API and user input to\nthe constructor should always be sanitised and type-checked.\n\n"
