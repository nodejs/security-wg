  "description": "HashDoS in V8",
  "overview": "The V8 release used in Node.js v24.0.0 has changed how string hashes are computed using rapidhash. This implementation re-introduces the HashDoS vulnerability as an attacker who can control the strings to be hashed can generate many hash collisions - an attacker can generate collisions even without knowing the hash-seed.\n\n* This vulnerability affects Node.js v24.x users.",
