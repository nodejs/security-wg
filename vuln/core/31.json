  ],
  "vulnerable": "4.x || 5.x",
  "patched": "^4.3.2 || ^5.7.1",
  "ref": "https://github.com/nodejs/node/pull/5507",
  "overview": "Fix a defect that can cause memory corruption in certain very rare cases\nrelating to the internal `BN_hex2bn()` and `BN_dec2bn()` functions. It is\nbelieved that Node.js is not invoking the code paths that use these functions so\npractical attacks via Node.js using this defect are _unlikely_ to be possible.\n\n"
