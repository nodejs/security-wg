  ],

  "ref": "https://nodejs.org/en/blog/vulnerability/june-2018-security-releases/",
  "overview": "Versions 9.7.0 and later are vulnerable and the severity is MEDIUM. A bug introduced in 9.7.0 increases the memory consumed when reading from the network into JavaScript using the net.Socket object directly as a stream. An attacker could use this cause a denial of service by sending tiny chunks of data in short succession. This vulnerability was restored by reverting to the prior behaviour."
