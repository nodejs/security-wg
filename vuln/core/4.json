  "description": "BN_mod_exp may produce incorrect results on x86_64",
  "overview": "As noted by the OpenSSL team, the likelihood of being able to craft a practical\nattack that uses this flaw is very low. In addition, Node.js enables\nSSL_OP_SINGLE_DH_USE, further decreasing the chance of a successful exploit of\nthis vulnerability in a Node.js service.\n\nAll active versions of Node.js are affected, but the severity is very low for\nNode.js users.\n\n"
