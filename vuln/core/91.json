  "overview": "Node.js did not handle multi-value Relative Distinguished Names correctly. Attackers could craft certificate subjects containing a single-value Relative Distinguished Name that would be interpreted as a multi-value Relative Distinguished Name, for example, in order to inject a Common Name that would allow bypassing the certificate subject verification. See https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2021-44533 for more details."
