  "slug": "node-krb5_spoofing-attack-due-to-unvalidated-kdc",
  "overview": "This module does not validate the KDC, which might allow an attacker with network access and enough time to spoof the KDC and impersonate a valid user without knowing their credentials.",
  "recommendation": "Consider using the \"[kerberos](https://www.npmjs.com/package/kerberos)\" npm module, which has this protection in place, or short of that, ensure there are no untrusted users on your network.",
