  "overview": "- restafary is a REpresentful State Transfer API for Creating, Reading, Using, Deleting files on a server from the web    - restafary is able to set up a root path, which should only allow it to run inside of that root path it specified.     - An attacker is able to provide a specifically crafted path to access files outside of this specified root path.        - Note: this is only possible if the attacker has access to the restafary application.
