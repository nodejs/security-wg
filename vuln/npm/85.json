  "overview": "A common setup to deploy to gh-pages on every commit via a CI system is to expose a github token to ENV and to use it directly in the auth part of the url. \n\nIn module versions < 0.9.1 the auth portion of the url is outputted as part of the grunt tasks logging function. If this output is publicly available then the credentials should be considered compromised.",
  "recommendation": "- Upgrade to version 1.0.0 or greater.\n- Consider any credentials used with these modules compromised and rotate those credentials.",
