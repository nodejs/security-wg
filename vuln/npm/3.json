  "overview": "Connect is a stack of middleware that is executed in order in each request.\n\nThe \"methodOverride\" middleware allows the http post to override the method of the request with the value of the \"_method\" post key or with the header \"x-http-method-override\".\n\nBecause the user post input was not checked, req.method could contain any kind of value. Because the req.method did not match any common method VERB, connect answered with a 404 page containing the \"Cannot [method] [url]\" content. The method was not properly encoded for output in the browser.\n\n\n###Example:\n```\n~ curl \"localhost:3000\" -d \"_method=<script src=http://nodesecurity.io/xss.js></script>\"\nCannot <SCRIPT SRC=HTTP://NODESECURITY.IO/XSS.JS></SCRIPT> /\n```\n\n###Credit:\n[Sergio Arcos](https://twitter.com/martes_trece)\n\n###History\n(2013-06-27) Bug reported:\nhttps://github.com/senchalabs/connect/issues/831\n\n(2013-06-27) First fix: escape req.method output\nhttps://github.com/senchalabs/connect/commit/277e5aad6a95d00f55571a9a0e11f2fa190d8135\n\n(2013-06-27) Second fix: whitelist\nhttps://github.com/senchalabs/connect/commit/126187c4e12162e231b87350740045e5bb06e93a",
  "recommendation": "Update to the newest version of Connect or disable methodOverride. It is not possible to avoid the vulnerability if you have enabled this middleware in the top of your stack.",
