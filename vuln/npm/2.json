  ],
  "vulnerable_versions": "<0.5.0",
  "patched_versions": ">=0.5.0",
  "overview": "When the ffprobe functionality is enabled on the server, HTTP POST requests can be made to /probe. These requests are passed to the ffprobe binary on the server. Through this HTTP endpoint it is possible to send a malformed source file name to ffprobe that results in arbitrary command execution.\n\n### Mitigating Factors:\nThe ffprobe functionality is not enabled by default. In addition, exploitation opportunities are limited in a standard configuration because the server binds to the local interface by default.",
  "recommendation": "An updated and patched version of the module (version 0.5.0) is available via npm. Users who have enabled the ffprobe functionality are especially encouraged to upgrade.",
