  "overview": "- electron-packager is a command line tool that packages Electron source code into `.app` and `.exe` packages. along with Electron.\n- The `--strict-ssl` command line option defaults to false if not explicitly set to true\n\nThis could allow an attacker to Man In The Middle (MITM) the step where electron-packager does the following step: \"Download all supported target platforms and arches of Electron using the installed electron-prebuilt version (and cache the downloads in ~/.electron)\" effecting the integrity of the package and the cached downloads in ~/.electron.\n\nThis only affects users using the electron-packager CLI. The strict-ssl option defaults to true for the node.js API.",
  "recommendation": "Upgrade to at least version 7.0.0\n\nIt's also recommended to delete the electron-download cache folder, by default named .electron, and located in your home folder. For example:\n\n```\nrm -rf ~/.electron\n```",
