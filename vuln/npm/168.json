  "overview": "Steroids is PhoneGap on Steroids, providing native UI elements, multiple WebViews and enhancements for better developer productivity. \n\nsteroids downloads zipped resources over HTTP, which leaves it vulnerable to MITM attacks.  It may be possible to cause remote code execution (RCE) by swapping out the requested tarball with an attacker controlled tarball if the attacker is on the network or positioned in between the user and the remote server.",
