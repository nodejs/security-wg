  "slug": "hapi_file-descriptor-leak-can-cause-dos-vulnerability",
  "overview": "Versions 2.0.x and 2.1.x have a file descriptor leak that when triggered repeatedly will cause the server to run out of file descriptors and the node process to die. The effort required to take down a server depends on the process file descriptor limit. No other side effects or exploits have been identified.\n\n### Impact\n\nThis vulnerability allows an attacker to take down a hapi-based server running versions 2.0.x and 2.1.x.\n\nThis does NOT affect hapi 1.x deployments.",
  "recommendation": "- Please upgrade to version 2.2.x or above as soon as possible.",
