  "overview": "This description pulled from the rubyonrails-security post.        Reported to NodeSecurity Project by Reed Loden.        CSRF Vulnerability in jquery-ujs and jquery-rails        There is an vulnerability in jquery-ujs and jquery-rails that can be used to    bypass CSP protections and allows attackers to send CSRF tokens to attacker domains.        In the scenario where an attacker might be able to control the href attribute of an anchor tag or    the action attribute of a form tag that will trigger a POST action, the attacker can set the    href or action to  https://attacker.com (note the leading space) that will be passed to JQuery,    who will see this as a same origin request, and send the users CSRF token to the attacker domain.",
