  "overview": "console-io is a module that allows users to implement a web console in their application. \n\nA malicious user could bypass the authentication and execute any command that the user who is running the console-io application is able to run. This means that if console-io was running from root, the attacker would have full access to the system. \n\nThis vulnerability exists because the console-io application does not configure socket.io to require authentication, which allows a malicious user to connect via a websocket to send commands and receive the response.",
