The client (which could in fact be the server in certain instances) is that one that allocates and sends the memory that is then echo'd by the server.\n\nA vulnerability was found in the ping functionality of the ws module which allowed clients to allocate memory by sending a ping frame. The ping functionality by default responds with a pong frame and the previously given payload of the ping frame. \n\nThis is exactly what you expect, but internally ws always transforms all data that we need to send to a Buffer instance and that is where the vulnerability existed. ws didn't do any checks for the type of data it was sending. With buffers in node when you allocate it when a number instead of a string it will allocate the amount of bytes.\n\n```\nvar x = new Buffer(100);\n// vs\nvar x = new Buffer('100');\n```\n\nThis would allocate 100 bytes of memory in the first example and just 3 bytes with 100 as value in the second example. So the client would allocate 100 bytes of non-zeroed buffer and send that to the server. \n\n\n\n## Example POC\n```\nvar ws = require('ws')\n\nvar server = new ws.Server({ port: 9000 })\nvar client = new ws('ws://localhost:9000')\n\nclient.on('open', function () {\n  console.log('open')\n  client.ping(50) // this sends a non-zeroed buffer of 50 bytes\n\n  client.on('pong', function (data) {\n    console.log('got pong')\n    console.log(data) // Data from the client. \n  })\n})\n```","recommendation":"Update to version 1.0.1 or greater.","references":["https://github.com/websockets/ws/releases/tag/1.0.1"],"cvss_vector":"CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:L/A:N","cvss_score":6.5,"coordinating_vendor":"^Lift Security"},"68":{"id":68,"created_at":"2016-01-04","updated_at":"2016-04-25","title":"Remote Memory Disclosure","author":{"name":"Feross Aboukhadijeh / Mathias Buss Madsen","website":null,"username":null},"module_name":"bittorrent-dht","publish_date":"2016-01-04","cves":[],"vulnerable_versions":"<5.1.3","patched_versions":">=5.1.3","overview":"A security issue was found in bittorrent-dht that allows someone to send a specific series of messages to a listening peer and get it to reveal internal memory.\n\nThere are two mitigating factors here, that slightly reduce the impact of this vulnerability:\n\n1.
