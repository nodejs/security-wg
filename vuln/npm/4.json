  ],
  "vulnerable_versions": "<3.0.0",
  "patched_versions": ">=3.0.0",
  "overview": "When CORS is enabled on a hapi route handler, it is possible to set a crumb token for a different domain. An attacker would need to have an application consumer visit a site they control, request a route supporting CORS, and then retrieve the token. With this token, they could possibly make requests to non CORS routes as this user.\n\nA configuration and scenario where this would occur is unlikely, as most configurations will set CORS globally (where crumb is not used), or not at all.",
  "recommendation": "Update to a version 3.0.0 or greater.",
