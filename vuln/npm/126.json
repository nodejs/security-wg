  "overview": "Swagger is a standardized library for documenting API endpoints and their parameters.  Swagger uses a JSON document to organize API endpoint parameter data.\n\nSwagger-ui contains a cross site scripting (XSS) vulnerability in the key names for the following object path in the JSON document:\n```\n .definitions.<USER_DEFINED>.properties.<INJECTABLE_KEY_NAME>\n```\nSupplying a key name with script tags causes arbitrary code execution.  In addition it is possible to load the arbitrary JSON files remotely via the `URL` query-string parameter.\n\nThis advisory is being disclosed before a public patched release is available because of a public Github issue documenting the vulnerability.",
  "recommendation": "Update to the latest version of swagger-ui.\n\nOur primary recommendation is to host swagger documentation on a separate domain distinct from the application domain.  Also, we recommend implementing a content security policy (CSP) that restricts the domains from which JSON files can be requested in order to avoid loading malicious JSON docs via the `URL` query string parameter.",
