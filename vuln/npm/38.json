  "overview": "Tomato is a Node.js web framework.\n\nThe tomato API has an admin service that is enabled by setting up an access_key in the config options. This access_key is intended to protect the API admin from unauthorized access.\n\nThe key is checked by checking to see if the access_key provided in the request is within the configured access_key string, not equal to. So a single character that's within the access key is sufficient to bypass this control.\n\n### Example:\nThis is the snippet of code that does the comparison to authorize requests.\n\n```\nif (access_key && config.master.api.access_key.indexOf(access_key) !== -1) {\n```\n\nFor an access_key that is set to anything that includes the letter 'a' the following request would be authorized.\n\n```\n$ curl -X POST \"http://localhost:8081/api/exec\" -H \"Content-Type: application/json\" -d @test -H \"access-key: a\"\n{\n \"cmd\": \"ls\",\n \"path\": \".\",\n \"stdout\": \"app.js\\nconfig.js\\nlog\\nnode_modules\\nserver.js\\n\",\n \"stderr\": \"\"\n}\n```\n\n### Mitigating factors:\n\nThe admin interface is disabled by default. The module author confirmed that the access_key should really be an array of access_keys, however based on variable name and documentation it was not clear that it should be an array. The vulnerability exists only if a string access_key is set.\n\nModule version 0.0.6 has been updated to ensure an array of keys is provided as well as documentation updates.",
