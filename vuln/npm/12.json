  "overview": "This description taken from the pull request provided by Patrick Kettner.\n\n[Background from the vulnerabilty finder](http://miki.it/blog/2014/7/8/abusing-jsonp-with-rosetta-flash/)\n\ntl:dr - someone created a alphanum only swf converter, which means that they can in theory use it as a callback at a JSONP endpoint, and as a result, send data across domains.\n\nPrepending callbacks with an empty inline comment breaks the flash parser, and prevents the issue. This is a fairly common solution currently being implemented by Google, Facebook, and Github.",
