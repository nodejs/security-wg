  "slug": "dns-sync_command-injection",
  "overview": "The dns-sync library for node.js allows resolving hostnames in a synchronous fashion\n\nAll versions of dns-sync prior to the release 0.1.1 were vulnerable to arbitrary command execution via maliciously formed hostnames.\n\nFor example:\n\n    var dnsSync = require('dns-sync');\n    console.log(dnsSync.resolve('$(id > /tmp/foo)'));\n\nThis is caused by the hostname being passed through a shell as part of a command execution.",
  "recommendation": "Upgrade to dns-sync version 0.1.1 or greater.",
