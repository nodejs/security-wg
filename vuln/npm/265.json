  "overview": "The clang-extra module installs LLVM's clang-extra tools.\n\nclang-extra downloads binary resources over HTTP, which leaves it vulnerable to MITM attacks.  It may be possible to cause remote code execution (RCE) by swapping out the requested resources with an attacker controlled copy if the attacker is on the network or positioned in between the user and the remote server.",
  "recommendation": "No fix is currently available for this vulnerability. The author did note that if llvm added HTTPS support that they would update the module.\n\nIt is our recommendation to not install or use this module at this time.",
