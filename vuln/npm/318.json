  "overview": "Http-signature is a Reference implementation of Joyents HTTP Signature Scheme.         In versions <=0.9.11, http-signature signs only the header values, but not the header names. This makes http-signature vulnerable to header forgery.         Thus, if an attacker can intercept a request, he can swap header names and change the meaning of the request without changing the signature.             For this example request:     ```    POST /pay HTTP/1.1    Host: example.com    Date: Thu, 05 Jan 2012 21:31:40 GMT    X-Payment-Source: src@money.com    X-Payment-Destination: dst@money.com    Authorization: Signature keyId=Test,algorithm=rsa-sha256,headers=x-payment-source x-payment-destination MDyO5tSvin5...    ```    The request can be changed to have the following:    ```    X-Payment-Source: dst@money.com // Emails switched    X-Payment-Destination: src@money.com    Authorization: Signature keyId=Test,algorithm=rsa-sha256,headers=x-payment-destination x-payment-source MDyO5tSvin5...    ```    and both would be signed:    ```    src@money.com\\n    dst@money.com\\n    ```    (Fuller explanation of this example on the [GitHub Issue](https://github.com/joyent/node-http-signature/issues/10))",
