Proposal to advance a Bug Bounty program for the Node.js organization

Security is an essential part of the ongoing success of the Node.js community. The community is a vital part of one of the most aggressive markets available providing critical runtime infrastructure for a growing percentage of the internet and corporate computing requirements in 2018. A bug bounty program has become a standard mechanism to improve the security posture of projects, organizations and companies at every level.

A bug bounty program is a mechanism to formally engage security researchers and developers in a way that provides benefits to the community along multiple vectors:

1) Improved Security Depth of Coverage • Finding security defects is specialized work that benefits from deep expertise and fresh eyes
2) Validate Nodejs as a secure platform • Expanding the community into the security world is a growth area and enables new audiences for nodejs to be proposed
3) Improved Security Scope of Coverage • Reduced Risk we have bugs that are undiscovered currently exposing ourselves and our users to unnecessary risk
4) Improved Process in SDLC • Ongoing analysis of discoveries provides an opportunity to improve security through practices and/or security focus and tooling.

The proposed process for considering a Bug Bounty program makes heavy reference to existing work that the Security WG has already started (establishing a triage team, organized disclosure system, etc.) and ongoing partnership with HackerOne. High level process:

[ ] Security WG reviews readiness
[ ] Security WG presents proposal to CTC
[ ] Security WG & CTC establish Bug Bounty Leader & Bug Bounty Team

Next steps

1) core team readiness review and architectural decisions
   - goals/kpi (scope, responsiveness goals, impact of defects, team size, budget)
   - private vs. public 
   - existing security analysis/backlog validation
2) engage community committee as there is a PR element
3) review and evolve draft note into a proposal

As preparation, the Security WG already has an organization within HackerOne and the general framework as well as the technical tools to offer a Bug Bounty program.

Questions
1) Do we have a security assessment of the current nodejs core?
2) Do we have any scope limitations on what we would declare? Should we bounty "LTS" version bugs and non-LTS the same (gut is yes)? Release vs. HEAD (gut is no)?
3) Do we have enough volunteer staff (need to get HackerOne help to know what the right number might should be)
4) Would a private bounty program be acceptable to start? If we did that how do we keep good communication about findings with the broader community?
5) Do we know where we will get sufficient funding sources? HackerOne I think has suggested they can help with some elements and that there are funds that can be tapped, but I don't have a sense of scope still.
