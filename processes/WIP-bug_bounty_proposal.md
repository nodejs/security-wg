Proposal to advance a Bug Bounty program for the Node.js organization

Security is an essential part of the ongoing success of the Node.js community. The commmunity is a vital part of one of the most agressive markets available providing critical runtime infrastructure for a growing percentage of the internet and corporate computing requirements in 2018. A bug bounty program has become a standard mechanism to improve the security posture of projects, organizations and companies at every level.

A bug bounty program is a mechanism to formally engage security researchers and developers in a way that provides benefits to the community along multiple vectors:

1) finding security defects is specialized work that benefits from deep expertise and fresh eyes
2) expanding the community into the security world is a growth area and enables new audiences for nodejs to be proposed
3) we have bugs that are undiscovered currently exposing ourselves and our users to unnecessary risk
4) ongoing analysis of discoveries provides an opportunity to improve security through practices and/or security focus and tooling.

The proposed process for considering a Bug Bounty program makes heavy reference to existing work that the Security WG has already started and ongoing partnership with HackerOne. High level process:

1) Security WG reviews readiness
2) Security WG presents proposal to CTC
3) Security WG & CTC establish Bug Bounty Leader & Bug Bounty Team

Prerequisites to moving forward

1) review and evolve draft note into a proposal
2) core team readiness review and architectural decisions 
   - goals/kpi (document responsiveness goals, impact of defects, team size, budget)
   - private vs. public 
   - existing security analysis/backlog validation
3) engage community committee as there is a PR element
