# Node.js Security Team

Node.js security team members are expected to keep all information that they have
privileged access to by being on the team completely private to the team. This
includes agreeing to not notify anyone outside the team of issues that have not
yet been disclosed publicly, including the existence of issues, expectations of
upcoming releases, and patching of any issues other than in the process of their
work as a member of the security team.

Membership on the security teams can be requested via an issue in the TSC repo,
and must be approved by current team members.

Members of the security teams should indicate that they accept the privacy
policies by PRing their acceptance to this file.
