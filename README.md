# Security Working Group

***Note: this group is in the process of seeking Charter by the TSC
(https://github.com/nodejs/TSC/issues/486)***

## Mandate

The Security Working Group's purpose is to achieve the highest level of security
for Node.js and community modules.

Its responsibilities are:

- Define and maintain security policies and procedures for:
  - the core Node.js project
  - other projects maintained by the Node.js Foundation technical group
- Work with the node security project to bring community vulnerability data into
  the foundation as a shared asset.
- Set up processes and procedures and follow these to ensure the vulnerability
  data is updated in an efficient and timely manner. For example, ensuring there
  are well documented processes for reporting vulnerabilities in community
  modules.
- Work to set a high standard for the Node.js project. Possibly efforts could
  include penetration testing, security reviews etc, review guidelines, coding
  standards etc.
- Review and recommend processes for handling of security reports (but not the
  actual handling of security reports, which are reviewed by a group of people
  directly delegated to by the TSC).
- Define and maintain policies and procedures for the coordination of security
  concerns within the external Node.js open source ecosystem.
- Offer help to npm package maintainers to fix high-impact security bugs
- Maintain and make available data on disclosed security vulnerabilities in:
  - the core Node.js project
  - other projects maintained by the Node.js Foundation technical group
  - the external Node.js open source ecosystem
- Promote improvement of security practices within the Node.js ecosystem
- Recommend security improvements for the core Node.js project
- Facilitate and promote the expansion of a healthy security service and product
  provider ecosystem vulnerabilities.

## Private Node.js core security group

The Node.js Security Working Group is _not_ responsible for managing incoming
security reports to the security@nodejs.org address, nor is it privy to or
responsible for preparing embargoed security patches and releases.

The [Node.js TSC][] maintains primary responsibility for the management of private
security activities for Node.js core but relies on the Node.js Security Working
Group to recommend and help maintain policies and procedures for that
management.
