## Private Node.js core security group

The Node.js Security Working Group is _not_ responsible for managing incoming security reports to the security@nodejs.org address, nor is it privy to or responsible for preparing embargoed security patches and releases.

The Node.js CTC maintains primary responsibility for the management of private security activities for Node.js core but relies on the Node.js Security Working Group to recommend and help maintain policies and procedures for that management.
