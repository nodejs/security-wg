## [Charter](https://github.com/nodejs/TSC/blob/master/WORKING_GROUPS.md#security)

The Ecosystem Security Working Group works to improve the security of the Node.js Ecosystem.

Responsibilities include:
* Work with the Node Security Platform to bring community vulnerability data into
  the foundation as a shared asset.
* Ensure the vulnerability data is updated in an efficient and timely manner. For example, ensuring there
  are well-documented processes for reporting vulnerabilities in community
  modules.
* Define and maintain policies and procedures for the coordination of security
  concerns within the external Node.js open source ecosystem.
* Offer help to npm package maintainers to fix high-impact security bugs.
* Maintain and make available data on disclosed security vulnerabilities in:
  * the core Node.js project
  * other projects maintained by the Node.js Foundation technical group
  * the external Node.js open source ecosystem
* Promote the improvement of security practices within the Node.js ecosystem.
* Facilitate and promote the expansion of a healthy security service and product
  provider ecosystem.

This Working Group is _not_ responsible for managing or responding to
security reports against Node.js itself. That responsibility remains with
the [Node.js TSC][].

## Node.js Bug Bounty Program

The Node.js project engages in an official bug bounty program for security researchers and responsible public disclosures. We have established a first draft of accepted criteria and npm modules and projects that are eligible for monetary reward at [Bug Bounty Criteria](./processes/bug_bounty_criteria.md).

The program is managed through the HackerOne platform at [https://hackerone.com/nodejs](https://hackerone.com/nodejs) with further details.

## Participate in Responsible Security Disclosure

As a module author you can provide your users with security guidelines regarding any exposures and vulnerabilities in your project, based on a responsible disclosure policy [document](https://github.com/nodejs/security-wg/blob/e2c03e62d73635a766156c6ea4f9aefb35c04603/processes/responsible_disclosure_template.md) we've already put in place.

You can show your users you take security matters seriously and drive higher confidence by following any of the below suggested actions:

1. Adding a `SECURITY.md` file in your repository that you can copy&paste from [us](https://github.com/nodejs/security-wg/blob/e2c03e62d73635a766156c6ea4f9aefb35c04603/processes/responsible_disclosure_template.md). Just like having a contribution of code of conduct guidelines, a security guideline will help user or bug hunters with the process of reporting a vulnerability or security concern they would like to share.

2. Adding our Responsible Security Dislosure badge to your project's README which links to the `SECURITY.md` document.
