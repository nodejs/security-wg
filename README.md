# Node.js Security Working Group

## Purpose

Purpose is *not* to respond to reports of security issues with Node.js, that is
done by the "security team", see https://github.com/nodejs/node#security

*todo*: should the team be identified in
https://github.com/nodejs/node#security?

Purpose is to be discussed in working group meetings, but topics raised in the
WG meeting at NINA16 included:

- Is it worth looking at getting a sec eval of node?

- What is security? Is there definitions that would help us? does CVE/CERT/?
  have classifications we can use? It would be helpful to have a stance on this
  so we can more clearly respond to issues that are reported or claimed as
  "security issues".

Ecosystem:

- sec-wg could take some responsibility for fixing ecosystem issues
- Best practices on sec problems could use definition and
  publication/evanglizing, so npmjs.org packages can follow a well-known and
  robust procedure:
  - What should an npm module author do if an issue is found in their module?
  - How should they deal with it?
  - Should there be a CVE?
  - How should we (node/the node foundation/sec-wg) communicate with the
    author?
  - Its possible there should be a community vulnerability response list, that
    is available if people want to report a vulnerability in community modules,
    but don't know how, and do not want it in a public issue/PR on the modules
    github repo.

Signed modules:
- @jasnell has some thoughts on this.

... _anything else I missed?_


## Private Node.js core security group

The Node.js Security Working Group is _not_ responsible for managing incoming security reports to the security@nodejs.org address, nor is it privy to or responsible for preparing embargoed security patches and releases.

The Node.js CTC maintains primary responsibility for the management of private security activities for Node.js core but relies on the Node.js Security Working Group to recommend and help maintain policies and procedures for that management.

## Members

_... could this be you?_

*TODO* @jasnell, @mdawson What is process to "join" a Working Group. Is it PR an
addition of your name, email address, and github handle to this section of the
README if you want to be involved?


*TODO* Is there some boilerplate we need? Should we describe how meetings are
announced, for example?
