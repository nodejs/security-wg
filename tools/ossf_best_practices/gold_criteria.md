# Security

## Use basic good cryptographic practices

_Note that some software does not need to use cryptographic mechanisms. If your project produces software that (1) includes, activates, or enables encryption functionality, and (2) might be released from the United States (US) to outside the US or to a non-US-citizen, you may be legally required to take a few extra steps. Typically this just involves sending an email. For more information, see the encryption section of [Understanding Open Source Technology & US Export Controls](https://www.linuxfoundation.org/resources/publications/understanding-us-export-controls-with-os-projects/)._

> The software produced by the project MUST support secure protocols for all of its network communications, such as SSHv2 or later, TLS1.2 or later (HTTPS), IPsec, SFTP, and SNMPv3. Insecure protocols such as FTP, HTTP, telnet, SSLv3 or earlier, and SSHv1 MUST be disabled by default, and only enabled if the user specifically configures it. If the software produced by the project does not support network communications, select "not applicable" (N/A).

**N/A. The project does not produce software that supports network communications, the final user is responsible for that when using Node.js.**

- [Issue to follow up](https://github.com/nodejs/security-wg/issues/1189)


> The software produced by the project MUST, if it supports or uses TLS, support at least TLS version 1.2. Note that the predecessor of TLS was called SSL. If the software does not use TLS, select "not applicable" (N/A).

**Met. Warning: Requires lengthier justification.**

## Secured delivery against man-in-the-middle (MITM) attacks

> The project website, repository (if accessible via the web), and download site (if separate) MUST include key hardening headers with nonpermissive values. (URL required)

**Unmet. One or more of the required security hardening headers is missing.**

# Analysis

> The project MUST apply at least one dynamic analysis tool to any proposed major production release of the software produced by the project before its release.
